# Tutorials

These guides will walk you through building and running FireSim for the first time.

- First, you'll build a Lion simulator for Primo using wake.
- Then, you'll simulate a pre-built Leopard image booting linux (which we have verified).

Then, optionally:

- In {ref}`making-a-workload-interactive` you will learn how to interactively log into a running simulator,
- In {ref}`using-snapshot-and-replay`, you'll learn how to capture full visibility waves on the FPGA.

Hit next to get started.
